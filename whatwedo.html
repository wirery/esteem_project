        <p class="para3_1">The Serenity Project challenges the increasing stigmatization of mental health and suicide,
            the shame
            survivors experience after trauma, and a lack of resources for at-risk women through our 3-step method: </p>

            The Serenity Project journey starts with a kick-off fashion show aimed at challenging our society’s notion
            of “beauty,” celebrating these women in the project to step out of their comfort zones and connect with
            their limitless potential, and inspire all women to persevere and find strength in celebration and
            community.
        </p><button class="vidbutton">Watch Video</button>
        <p class="para3_3">We aim to impact our women for not just their time in participating in the project, but for the entirety of
            their lives. Through our annual Serenity Project Runway Fashion Show, women will learn to step out of their
            comfort zones, harness their inner power and limitless potential, and inspire all women to persevere and
            find strength in celebration and community. </p>

        <h1 class="title3_4">Curriculum</h1>
        <p class="para3_4">Next comes a 12-month virtual curriculum building skills to thrive! Inspiring women speakers, evidenced-based
            self-improvement and self-help exercises, challenges, readings, and so much more!</p> <button class="butterflybutton">Become A
            Butterfly</button>
        <p class="para3_5">The curriculum name, Soaring, comes from the idea that women are like butterflies, taking their wings and
            soaring to new heights. It teaches them to be brave enough to fly. </p>
            <p class="para3_6">The curriculum runs alongside The Serenity Project Mentorship program from the start of February, one week before the fashion show, for approximately one year. Some examples of themes for chapters are self-image, independent exploration, professional development, and impactful storytelling.</p>

        <p class="para3_7">Our 1-1 women mentorship program empowers women survivors to chase their dreams through developing meaningful
            passion projects alongside women entrepreneurs and leaders.</p><button class="mentorbutton">Become A Mentor</button>
        <p class="para3_8">Each participant is paired with a mentor, who supports participants in developing projects that pay their
            experiences forward. Paying it forward is truly transformative for healing.

            Next, the womxn embark on a journey of personal and professional development through a 12 chapter and
            yearlong curriculum, allowing womxn to be paired with a powerful mentor and participate through challenges,
            projects, weekly exercises, inspiring womxn guest speakers, and much more. The curriculum builds skills
            (i.e. self-compassion, meditation, public speaking) while mentors support survivors to develop projects that
            pay their experiences forward.</p>
