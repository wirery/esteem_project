    <div><h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p>The Serenity Project challenges the increasing stigmatization of mental health and suicide, the shame survivors experience after trauma, and a lack of resources for at-risk women through our 3-step method: </p></div>
    <div><h1>Our Approach</h1>
    <h2>Fashion Show</h2><p>
        The Serenity Project journey starts with a kick-off fashion show aimed at challenging our society’s notion of “beauty,” celebrating these women in the project to step out of their comfort zones and connect with their limitless potential, and inspire all women to persevere and find strength in celebration and community.

    <p>We aim to impact our women for not just their time in participating in the project, but for the entirety of their lives. Through our annual Serenity Project Runway Fashion Show, women will learn to step out of their comfort zones, harness their inner power and limitless potential, and inspire all women to persevere and find strength in celebration and community. </p></div>
    <div><h1>Curriculum</h1>
    <p>Next comes a 12-month virtual curriculum building skills to thrive!  Inspiring women speakers, evidenced-based self-improvement and self-help exercises, challenges, readings, and so much more!</p> <button>Become A Butterfly</button><p>The curriculum name, Soaring, comes from the idea that women are like butterflies, taking their wings and soaring to new heights. It teaches them to be brave enough to fly.  </p><p>The curriculum name, Soaring, comes from the idea that women are like butterflies, taking their wings and soaring to new heights.

    <div><h1>Mentorship</h1><p>Our 1-1 women mentorship program empowers women survivors to chase their dreams through developing meaningful passion projects alongside women entrepreneurs and leaders.</p><button>Become A Mentor</button><p>Each participant is paired with a mentor, who supports participants in developing projects that pay their experiences forward. Paying it forward is truly transformative for healing.

        Next, the womxn embark on a journey of personal and professional development through a 12 chapter and yearlong curriculum, allowing womxn to be paired with a powerful mentor and participate through challenges, projects, weekly exercises, inspiring womxn guest speakers, and much more. The curriculum builds skills (i.e. self-compassion, meditation, public speaking) while mentors support survivors to develop projects that pay their experiences forward.</p></div>
