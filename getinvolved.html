        <h2>Become a Participant</h2>
        <p>The Serenity Project is looking for women that are characterized as “at-risk” to participate in our program. Past participants include survivors of domestic violence, foster care, body dysmorphia, PTSD, bullying, trauma, and acid attacks. This list is not exhaustive by any means. Our aim is to tackle the rising suicide rates of at-risk women, so any woman who is vulnerable is encouraged to apply!</p>
