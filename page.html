        <P class="para2_2">Suicide is among the leading causes of death for at-risk women. We focus our efforts on women
            survivors of trauma (including domestic violence, acid attacks, and body dysmorphia). With mental health
            stigmatization, societal shaming of survivors, and a lack of tools for at-risk women to gain confidence, we
            aim to enrich and save the lives of women in our project. These women deserve to be celebrated for their
            perseverance and invested in for their future. </P>

        <h1 class="title2_4">Serene Singh</h1>
        <p class="para2_3">Serene made TSP after losing a best friend, a survivor, to suicide. As a model, she saw the
            effect of unhealthy beauty ideals, but also, the power runways have to grow confidence. While working in the
            US Senate on violence, trafficking, and rape policies she noticed womxn survivors were never in-charge of
            the settings where changes impacting survivors were created. Serene dreamt of empowering survivors to dream
            again. Transforming pain into power.

            A former America’s Junior Miss and Miss Colorado Teen, Singh’s pageantry and modeling experience inspires
            her to empower for women worldwide, which has led her to create The Serenity Project nonprofit to give
            confidence tools to at-risk women, work for Mrs. Obama and the Girls Opportunity Alliance to improve girls’
            education, win Victoria Secret’s GRL PWR campaign, and serve as a Dalai Lama Fellow, Global Changemaker, and
            Clinton Global Initiative Scholar.</p>
