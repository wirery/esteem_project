        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <P>Suicide is among the leading causes of death for at-risk women. We focus our efforts on women survivors of trauma (including domestic violence, acid attacks, and body dysmorphia). With mental health stigmatization, societal shaming of survivors, and a lack of tools for at-risk women to gain confidence, we aim to enrich and save the lives of women in our project. These women deserve to be celebrated for their perseverance and invested in for their future. </P>
